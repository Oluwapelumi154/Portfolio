          A passionate and results-driven software engineer with 4 years of
          experience specializing in React, Angular, and Node.js. Throughout my
          career, I've had the opportunity to work on a diverse range of
          projects, building scalable and efficient web applications from the
          ground up. I take pride in crafting clean, maintainable, and
          responsive user interfaces using React and Angular, while ensuring
          optimal performance and a seamless user experience. On the backend,
          I'm experienced in leveraging Node.js to create fast and reliable
          server-side solutions. Iâ€™m always excited to learn new technologies,
          optimize workflows, and collaborate with teams to build impactful
          solutions. I strive to stay updated with the latest trends in the tech
          industry, ensuring that the applications I build are not only
          functional but also future-proof. When I'm not coding, I enjoy
          exploring new challenges, improving my skills, and contributing to
          open-source projects.
